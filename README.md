# LC_TitleVideos

Adds videos to the background of the Lethal Company title screen.
Custom videos can be added in "BepInEx/plugins/NotCasey-LC_TitleVideos/TitleVideos" folder.

If you have an issue with the mod, submit it on the GitHub issues.

If you have a cool background video you want to add as one of the pre-built videos, send it to _notcasey on Discord. (Must be footage of unmodded Lethal Company that I think is cool)

TODO:
- Pick any video file from a folder titled "TitleVideos" in the BepInEx folder, so it doesn't matter where the videos are located for ease of access.

# LC_TitleVideos

Adds videos to the background of the Lethal Company title screen.
To add custom videos, add videos to the existing 'TitleVideos' folder, or create a new 'TitleVideos' folder anywhere in the BepInEx folder.

You can disable the built-in videos, and configure how many times a video loops before it changes to a different video, either randomly picked or in a sequence.
By default, videos will not alternate.

If you have an issue with the mod or a feature suggestion, submit it on the GitHub issues.
